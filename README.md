# üñºÔ∏è Spring Boot S3 Image CRUD API ( using LocalStack)

This project demonstrates how to build a full **image storage CRUD API** for using
AWS S3 SDK locally using:
- ‚úÖ Java 21 + Spring Boot 3
- ‚úÖ AWS SDK
- ‚úÖ AWS S3 via LocalStack
- ‚úÖ File upload/download
- ‚úÖ Swagger UI for testing
- ‚úÖ UUID key generation to avoid filename collisions

---

## üöÄ Features

- Upload image files via `POST /images/upload`
- Retrieve raw image bytes or redirect to S3 URL
- List all stored images (key + URL)
- Replace/update an image by key
- Delete an image by key
- Works entirely **locally using LocalStack** ‚Äî no AWS account needed

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/springboot-s3-demo.git
cd springboot-s3-demo
```

### 2. Start LocalStack & Create Bucket
(see the file)

```bash
chmod +x start-localstack.sh
./start-localstack.sh
```
This will:
- Start LocalStack using Docker Compose
- Wait for it to be ready
- Create the S3 bucket `my-images`

### 3. Run the Spring Boot App

```bash
